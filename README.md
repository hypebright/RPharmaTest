Testing can be extremely annoying. If you've got so far to even write tests, you need to be able to run them quickly and easily. This package is a minimal example of how to set up a package with tests that can be run with GitHub Actions.

And that's not all: it also includes a minimal example of how to set up test coverage with [Codecov](https://codecov.io/)!
